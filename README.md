## 🐧 Use a Suitable Linux Distro

If you're diving into DevOps, choosing the right Linux distribution can make a big difference. One excellent option is [**Exodia OS**](https://exodia-os.github.io/), a highly customized, Arch-based distro tailored for cybersecurity professionals and developers.

Exodia OS comes with a built-in app also called **Exodia OS**, which includes a **"Role"** tab. This feature helps you:

- Learn and follow a guided path
- Manage your development environment
- Select a role based on your goals (e.g., DevOps, Pentester, Developer, etc.)

### 👤 DevOps Role in Exodia OS

When you select the **DevOps** role, you'll get access to:

#### 📌 Roadmap
A curated roadmap to guide your learning path step-by-step
