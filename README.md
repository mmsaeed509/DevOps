## 🐧 Use a Suitable Linux Distro

If you're diving into DevOps, choosing the right Linux distribution can make a big difference. One excellent option is [**Exodia OS**](https://exodia-os.github.io/), a highly customized, Arch-based distro tailored for cybersecurity professionals and developers.

Exodia OS comes with a built-in app also called **Exodia OS**, which includes a **"Role"** tab. This feature helps you:

- Learn and follow a guided path
